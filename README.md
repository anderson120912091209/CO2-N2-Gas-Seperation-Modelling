# CO2-N2-Gas-Seperation-Modelling
With the increasing urgency to address climate change, carbon capture technology has become essential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO₂), primarily emitted from industrial sources, is one of the largest contributors to global warming. Effective capture and separation of CO₂ from nitrogen (N₂) in exhaust gases are critical steps toward reducing emissions. This project focuses on modeling CO₂ and N₂ separation, leveraging membrane technology to optimize purity and recovery in the separation process. By understanding the behavior of CO₂ and N₂ under various conditions of Permeate Pressure and Stages configuration, we aim to improve the efficiency of carbon capture systems, making them a more viable solution for reducing industrial CO₂ emissions.
