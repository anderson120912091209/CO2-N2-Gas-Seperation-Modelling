# CO2-N2-Gas-Seperation-Modelling
Carbon capture is crucial in mitigating climate change by reducing industrial CO₂ emissions. This project models CO₂ and N₂ separation in exhaust gases, focusing on membrane technology to optimize purity and recovery. Understanding CO₂ and N₂ behavior under different conditions aims to enhance carbon capture efficiency for a sustainable future.
